# From Linear Algebra to Machine Learning

Here, I want to study the relevance of *linear algebra* in the implementation of
*machine learning* algorithms. I believe that the best way to understand machine
learning algorithms is implementing them from scratch, so, in this material, I
want to review also *vectorization*.

I will be updating and improving these notes from time to time, adding
theoretical concepts and their corresponding implementation and visualization.
I will be using Python, Numpy, and Tensorflow, and later, maybe R.

## Presentations

I did present a very basic material in the conferences:

- EuroPython 2018 
- FrOSCon 2018 [Video](https://media.ccc.de/v/froscon2018-2220-from_linear_algebra_to_machine_learning)
